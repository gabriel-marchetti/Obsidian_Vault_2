The first point that the book make is that Fulfillment and Happiness don't come by chance. That means, to achieve it we must think, plan and take actions to acquire it and especially, change course when you've made mistakes.

Today leading a remarkable life is almost impossible to think. Since many people said through media that it is, so have a job a resonates with your personal goal is almost impossible as well. So the first premise of this book is that it is not impossible to achieve it.

One important detail about working. Assume you started working at your 20s and you are going to work up to 65 years, then you would've worked for about 40 years. If you work for 200 days per year, which is not most of the cases, then you would have worked 8000 days. Assuming you worked for at least 5 hours each day, then you would have worked 40.000 hours. This is a lot of hours. So choosing something you like is crucial, since the most time of your day will be working. 
More on that, once we have achieve our needs, i.e., food and shelter. The rest of work resumes in achieving happiness. But, it is pretty common that we want to get more money and so we will sell our lives in sake of money.

Think of a musician for example. When they are starting to play music they want to achieve greatness and that is what drive them, although most of them resort of getting money through something else like teaching or doing a completely different job. Here in software development the same mind can be used, we develop software to make something big, that can be used by millions of people around the world, something useful that people will be pleased that it exists. In pursuing this objective we are much more likely to achieve it, than someone that is living by coincidence.

### The four main points.
- **Choose your Market.**
- **Invest in your Product.** (time is investment as well and you are part of the product)
- **Execute:** How to make yourself deliver in order to make your product more valuable.
- **Market:** Let people know your product.

# Choosing your Market.

In  [[The_Pragmatic_Programmer]] it is said the term "[[Programming_By_Coincidence]]" which basically sketches one programmer that searches an already make program and just make slightly changes to see what will change and just to suit them. This is actually pretty common in software development and assuming that a software is a business, you are basically handling your business to someone else. 
So your career in software development is also a business and you nee to ask yourself pertinent questions about it.
- What are the services you want to offer?
- Who are you going to sell your services?
- Is demand for your service going to grow or decline over the coming years?
- How big of a gamble are you willing to take on these choices?
